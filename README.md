# Physics Games Collection

A Flutter project showcasing various physics-based games and simulations, starting with a Newton's Cradle implementation.

## About

This project was primarily developed with the assistance of AI Cursor. It serves as a collection of physics-based games and simulations built using Flutter.

### Current Features

- Newton's Cradle simulation with:
  - Pure Dart implementation
  - Forge2D (Box2D) physics engine implementation
  - Interactive controls for simulation parameters
  - Animated wave background

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:
1. To publish an Android app without requiring a Google Play Store account
2. To create an expanding collection of physics-based games and simulations
3. To demonstrate Flutter's capabilities in creating interactive physics simulations

## Future Plans

More physics games and simulations will be added to this collection, making it a comprehensive showcase of physics-based interactions in Flutter.

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Use `flutter run` to start the app
